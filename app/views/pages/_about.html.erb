      <div class="pitch">
        <p>After a <strong>Master's</strong> at the <strong>Paris School of Business</strong>, my experiences in business developpement and trade/digital marketing, especially in the start-up environment pushed me to dig deeper into technical skills.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the <strong>Web Development</strong> program at <strong>Le Wagon</strong> where I learned to build websites and I really thrived in this constant-learning process that is coding!</p>
        <p>Since then I have been building <strong>Websites</strong> & <strong>E-commerce</strong> platforms from scratch using code as well as no-code tools, I am particularly interested in algorithm and UX design, and I am also a <strong>Teacher Assistant</strong> at Le Wagon.</p>
